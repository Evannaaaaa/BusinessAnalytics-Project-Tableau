Exploring the Association between Education Level and Gender Equality: A Global Perspective

•	Conducted comprehensive data analysis on a dataset of 11,475 data points sourced from WorldBank, covering a period from 1998-2018, to explore the correlation between education level and gender equality indicators globally.  
•	Utilized Tableau to create a diverse range of visualizations, including Scatter Plots, Heatmaps, and Bubble Charts, to effectively convey complex relationships between 17 variables across 675 rows.  
•	Employed statistical models to identify key predictors affecting gender equality:  
o	Linear Regression revealed that tertiary school enrollment is the strongest predictor for female life expectancy at birth.  
o	Neural Networks pinpointed the pupil-teacher ratio in tertiary education as the most impactful variable on female wage and salaried workers.  
o	Random Forest algorithms found that the number of female academic staff in tertiary education was the most significant factor affecting fertility rates.  
o	The analytical workflow led to actionable insights, deepening the understanding of how educational levels influence gender equality on a global scale.
